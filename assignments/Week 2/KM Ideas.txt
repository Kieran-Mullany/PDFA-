Most up to date is the Rough Work Jupyter Notebook
Can retrieve data, can plot.
Labelling is very messy for Date and time because there are 89 data points
    [1] check into increasing scale - ticks?
I have seperated the 2 days out so the plot changes colour for day 2
    [2] Maybe remove the date part of the axis ?
        I would have duplicate times (over 2 days) and a colour scheme to show Day 1 and Day 2
        Plot wouldn't be effected because date and time have been used to plot it is only an isue because cannot read date and time 

Working well, needs fine tuning
